Hey %s! It looks like you need some help!
I'm always listening so I'll do my best to respond to you.

These are things you can ask me to do for you:
**bap @target**: Put your newspaper to good use and deliver a bap to a pony's head!
**boop @target**: I'll go and boop the snoot of whomever you mention here! Don't boop me though, that's illegal.
**megaboop @target**: Megaboops drain a lot of my power, so you can only megaboop once per day.
**block**: If you're quick enough, you can block a megaboop and reduce the amount of damage it deals.
**hug @target**: I'll let the mentioned person know you hugged them. (You can also hug me. I like hugs too)
**megahug @target**: These are hugs for when you *really* want to hug someone. But you only get one of these per day!
**!when**: I'll tell you how much longer it is until the next iteration of GalaCon! Wooo!

I also listen to certain words and sentences!
**Assfart**: I honestly don't know why this is a thing...
**Bizaam**: BIIZAAAAAM!
**Bye**: I'll say a quick goodbye when you're leaving.
**Canni is worst pony**: I don't know why you would say something like this, but if you do it too often I'll just stop talking to you for a bit...
**Fanta**: Unlike Perry, I like making Fanta jokes.
**Good morning**: I'll wish you a good morning whenever I hear your voice! Or well, read your text.
**Good night, Nighty night, Night**: I'll wish you good night!
**Hello, Hi**: I'll say hi to you as well.
**Hype**: HYPE!!!!!!1!!1!
**Who is best pony**: I'll definitely let you know who I think is best!
**[x] is best pony**: I have an opinion about this too.

Oh! And I'll respond to you if you @mention me! But please don't be mad at me if I don't understand you.
I respond to these things:
**@Canni Can I have a hug**: Of course you can, silly! I love giving hugs!
**@Canni Compliment me**: Sure! I'm still learning about compliments though, so don't be mad at me if I say something silly, okay?
**@Canni Compliment @target**: This is for when you want me to compliment someone else. That's very nice of you.
**@Canni How are you**: It's so nice of you to ask about me!
**@Canni How many members are on the server**: Erm, let me count quickly...
**@Canni I love you**: I like this one. It's much better than calling me worst pony.
**@Canni I'm sorry**: You know, for when you called me worst pony. That was mean, but I might just forgive you.
**@Canni I'm [sick|hurt|injured|sad]**: Oh no! That's no good! Let me quickly get my sister. She'll take care of you!
**@Canni I'm happy**: That's lovely. My sister is doing a good job taking care of everyone.
**@Canni Let's play a game**: Sure! I'd love to play a game!
**@Canni When is galacon**: I'll let you know how much longer it is until the next time we'll see each other at GalaCon!
**@Canni /)**: /)*(\

Did you know I'm not just charming, but also a smart bot? I can solve all the math problems you can think of!
You can ask me like this:
**@Canni solve `1+2`**: This is just an example, but I can solve simple problems like 1+2 with ease!
**@Canni solve multi `x=3,y=4,z=x+y,z`**: Yep, even complex problems are a breeze!

So that's it! If you've any more questions about me, you should probably ask one of my creators.
